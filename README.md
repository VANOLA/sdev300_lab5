# SDEV 300 Lab 5 - CSV Files and Analysis

## Overview
This is the 5th lab for the UMGC class SDEV 300. This week, I learned about file I/O, exception handling, and object oriented programming.
This exercise allows a user to load one of two CSV files and then perform histogram analysis and plots for select variables on the
datasets. The first dataset represents the population change for specific dates for U.S. regions. The second dataset represents Housing data
over an extended period of time describing home age, number of bedrooms and other variables. The first row provides a column name for each dataset.
